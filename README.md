# 3D-Binary-Star-System-Simulation-with-Energy-and-Work-Analysis-in-VPython
This simulation models the motion of a binary star system using Newtonian mechanics in 3D space with VPython. It tracks the position, velocity, momentum, kinetic energy, potential energy, work, and total mechanical energy of two interacting stars over time.
